00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,782
What is this file size?

242
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,451
1 .2 megabytes? No way.

243
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,413
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

244
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,376
The file size is like, half.

245
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,836
And look how fast this search is.

246
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,925
Holy shit, how did it
find a match that fast?

247
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,096
It's like it's searching compressed files?

248
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,765
No way.
